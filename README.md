# IEEE@IIT Website

This is the website for the IEEE Illinois Institute of Technology student branch. The website is live at [ieee.iit.edu](http://ieee.iit.edu/).

## Tools used

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator
* [Solid](https://st4ple.github.io/solid-jekyll/), a Bootstrap theme for Jekyll
* [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers), a template engine which was written with very specific requirements

---

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) port of the [Solid theme](http://www.blacktie.co/2014/05/solid-multipurpose-theme/) by [blacktie.co](http://www.blacktie.co/). Visit the [live demo](https://st4ple.github.io/solid-jekyll/) for a preview. 


## Usage
#### Customize  
Most general settings and data like site name, colors, address, etc. can be configured and changed right in the main config file: `/_config.yml`
The content of the Home page can be changed here: `/home.html`
The content of the About page can be changed here: `/about.html`
The content of the Portfolio page can be changed here:`/portfolio.html`
The content of the Contact page can be changed here:`/contact.html`
#### Add content  
Delete the demo content and publish your own content.
##### Blog post
Create a Blog post by creating a file called `yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-post-like-this.markdown` in the `/_posts/blog/` directory with the following template:
```markdown
---
layout: post          #important: don't change this
title: "Name of post like this"
date: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
author: Name
categories:
- blog                #important: leave this here
- category1
- category2
- ...
img: post01.jpg       #place image (850x450) with this name in /assets/img/blog/
thumb: thumb01.jpg    #place thumbnail (70x70) with this name in /assets/img/blog/thumbs/
---
This text will appear in the excerpt "post preview" on the Blog page that lists all the posts.
<!--more-->
This text will not be shown in the excerpt because it is after the excerpt separator.
```

```

#### Can I use this theme for my website?
Of course you can!
```
#### Publish
To publish with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), simply create a branch called `gh-pages`in your repository. GitHub will build your site automatically and publish it at `http://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/`.  
If there are problems with loading assets like CSS files and images, make sure that the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml`is set correctly (it should say `/repositoryname`).
